# CP

> A Coordination Protocol helps to manage complexity and ensure consistency in how tools, technologies and people work together. Our 'CP' is called BASICS, which stands for 'Business Assistance System'. Just as the BASIC computer language sought to increase access to programming, we are now expanding access to business management.
